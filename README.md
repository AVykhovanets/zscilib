# Zephyr Scientific Library (zscilib)

[![API Documentation](doc/img/badge_api.svg)][1]

[1]: https://zscilib.github.io/zscilib/

The **Zephyr Scientific Library (zscilib)** is an attempt to provide a set of
functions useful for scientific computing, data analysis and data manipulation
in the context of resource constrained embedded hardware devices.

It is written entirely in C, and while the main development target for the
library is the [Zephyr Project](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr),
it tries to be as portable as possible, and a standalone reference project
is included to use this library in non-Zephyr-based projects.

This version of zscilib has been developed and tested against **Zephyr 2.2**.

## Quick Start: Zephyr

### Adding zscilib to your project via `west`

For project that have been setup using `west`, you can add a local copy of
zscilib by adding the following sections to `zephyr/west.yml`:

1. In the `manifest/remotes` section add:

```
remotes:
  - name: zscilib
    url-base: https://github.com/zscilib
```

2. In the `manifest/projects` section add:

```
- name: zscilib
  remote: zscilib
  path: modules/lib/zscilib
  revision: master
```

3. Save the file, and run `west update` from the project root to retrieve the
latest version of zscilib from Github, or whatever `revision` was specified
above.

### Running the benchmark sample

To run the benchmark sample using qemu, run the following commands:

> Be sure to run `source zephyr/zephyr-env.sh` (OS X or Linux) or
  `.\zephyr\zephyr-env.cmd` (Windows) before the commands below!

```
$ west build -p -b qemu_cortex_m3 modules/lib/zscilib/samples/benchmarking -t run
```

Press **`CTRL+A`** then **`x`** to quit qemu.

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for this library, run the following command:

```
$ sanitycheck -p qemu_cortex_m3 -T modules/lib/zscilib/tests
```

See the `tests` folder for further details.

### Note: Float Stack Usage in Zephyr

The sample code in this library typically has the `CONFIG_FLOAT` option set,
meaning that floating-point support is configured for
[Unshared FP registers mode][2]. This mode is used when the application
has a **single thread** that uses floating point registers.

If your application makes use of **multiple threads**, and more than one of
these threads uses floating-point operations, you should also enable the
`CONFIG_FP_SHARING` config flag, which configures the kernel for
[Shared FP registers mode][3]. In this mode, the floating point registers are
saved and restored during each context switch, even when the associated threads
are not using them. This feature comes at the expense of an extra 72 bytes of
stack memory per stack frame (`s0..s15` + `FPCSR`, plus an alignment word
to ensure that the stack pointer is double-word aligned).

## Quick Start: Standalone

A few makefile-based projects are included in `samples/standalone` showing
how zscilib can be used independent of Zephyr.

If you already have an appropriate GNU toolchain and build tools (`make`, etc.)
installed, you can simply execute the following commands:

```
$ cd samples/standalone/svd_pinv
$ make
$ bin/zscilib
  Hello, zscilib!
  ...
```

## Motivation

As the processing power of small, embedded MCUs increases and costs fall, more
computation can be done on the endnode itself. This allows for more of the
'complex' data analysis that used to take place at the PC or server level
(data aggregation, statistical analysis, etc.) to be done in less time,
using less data storage, and at a lower overall processing cost.

> A key goal of zscilib is to allow more data processing to happen on the
  endnode.

By generating immediately actionable and scientifically-relevant data points
(standard SI units, pre-filtered data, etc.) directly on the endnode, zscilib
aims to be a bridge between raw data and more numerically complex toolkits like
`gsl`, `numpy` or `R`.

#### What makes zscilib distinct?

Numerous high quality, mature, open source scientific libraries already exist:

- [GNU scientific library (gsl)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
- [Lis (Library of Iterative Solvers for linear systems)](https://github.com/anishida/lis)
- [CMSIS-DSP](http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/DSP/html/index.html)

Despite the wealth of mature functions in these existing libraries, though,
they tend to have the following two problems in an embedded context:

- They are overly broad and resource intensive (GSL, etc.), and thus aren't
  appropriate for small, resource constrained devices like the ARM Cortex M
  family.
- They are missing many of the domain-specific features required to convert
  raw sensor data into actionable information (CMSIS-DAP, Lis).

The second item is of particular importance, since the goal of embedded systems
is often 'sensing' via raw data, correlating that data, and acting on the final
data points or passing them on for further analysis.

CMSIS-DAP contains a number of highly efficient algorithms for filtering
raw sensor data, but it doesn't offer any domain-specific assistance converting
filtered accelerometer vectors into orientation data, for example, or reading
a set of photodiodes and converting that data into a useful photometric value
like lux. It is excellent at 'conditioning' data, but not at 'understanding' it.

zscilib aims to find a middle ground between these two, allowing for richer
processing of raw data, but within the confines and limitations of the class
of microcontrollers commonly used on low-cost sensor endnodes.

## Architecture-Specific Optimisations

Basic tooling has been added to allow for optimised architecture-specific
implementations of key functions in assembly.

At present, this feature isn't being actively used or developed, but an aim
of zscilib is to add optimised versions of key functions to try to get the
best possible performance out of limited resources.

Initial optimisation will target the **ARM Cortex-M** family of devices and the
**Thumb** and **Thumb-2** instruction sets, though other architectures can be
accommodated if necessary or useful.

## Code Style

Since the primary target of this codebase is running as a module in
[Zephyr OS][CS0], it follows the same [coding style][CS1], which is itself
based on the [Linux kernel coding style][CS2].

You can format the source code to match this style automatically using the
[uncrustify][CS3] command line tool, which has plugins available for many
common text editors (Atom Beautify, for example).
